        <p>
          Bases in the same organization can use each other’s data. TableOS does this with <b>synced tables</b>: a read-only copy of a table
          from another base that stays up to date automatically. Because it is a normal table in your base, you can link to it and use lookups,
          rollups, filters and formulas with it.
        </p>
        <h2>Add a synced table</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Click <b>+</b> next to the table tabs and choose <b>Sync from another base</b> (or choose it in the “Add a table” dialog).</li>
          <li>Pick the base and table. You only see bases you can read.</li>
          <li>TableOS copies the fields and records. The tab shows a ⇄ badge.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Link to a table in another base</h2>
        <p>
          When you create a <b>Link to another record</b> field, choose <b>+ Link to a table in another base</b>. TableOS adds a synced copy of that
          table (or reuses one that already exists) and links to it, so a lookup or rollup can bring in any of its fields.
        </p>
        <h2>How syncing works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in the source table arrive within a few seconds. A full check also runs every few minutes (5 by default).</li>
          <li>Field renames, new fields, type changes and deleted fields are copied too.</li>
          <li>The bar above a synced table shows when it last synced. Use <b>Sync now</b>, <b>Pause</b> or <b>Resume</b> there or in the tab menu.</li>
          <li>
            Synced fields and records are read-only, and you can’t add or delete records. You <b>can</b> add your own fields (notes, links, formulas)
            to a synced table; those stay editable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stop syncing</b> (tab menu) keeps the table and its data as a normal, editable table that is no longer updated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Warn>
          A sync runs with the access of the person who created it. If that person loses access to the source base, the sync stops with an error until
          someone with access sets it up again.
        </Warn>
        <h2>Sync from HubSpot</h2>
        <p>
          A synced table can also come from HubSpot: contacts, companies, deals or tickets. Choose <b>Sync from HubSpot</b> when adding a table.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In HubSpot, create a <b>private app</b> (Settings → Integrations → Private apps) with read scopes for what you want, for example{" "}
            <code>crm.objects.contacts.read</code>. Add <code>crm.objects.owners.read</code> to see owner names.
          </li>
          <li>Paste the app’s access token to connect. It is stored encrypted and only you can use the connection.</li>
          <li>Pick the object and the properties to bring in. TableOS also adds the record’s name, HubSpot ID and a link back to HubSpot.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Changes made in HubSpot show up within a couple of minutes, and a full refresh runs every 15 minutes (use <b>Sync now</b> any time).
          Dropdown properties become select fields, numbers, dates and checkboxes keep their types, and records deleted in HubSpot are removed here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Two-way sync.</b> Tick <b>Two-way sync</b> when setting up the table, or the <b>Two-way</b> box on the bar above it. Edits to synced fields
          are then written back to HubSpot within a second or two. The private app needs write scopes such as <code>crm.objects.contacts.write</code>.
          Calculated and read-only HubSpot properties (create date, last modified, the HubSpot ID) stay read-only, and records are still added or
          deleted in HubSpot. If HubSpot rejects a value (for example an unknown dropdown option), the bar shows why and HubSpot’s value comes back on
          the next sync. Only the person who set up the sync can turn two-way on, since edits are written with their HubSpot account.
        </p>
        <h2>Connectors</h2>
        <p>
          Airtable and HubSpot accounts live under <b>Account menu → Connectors</b> and work in every base you can edit. Gmail and Slack are connected
          right in the automation step that uses them (pick <b>+ Connect another account</b> in its account list to add more). Only you can use the
          accounts you connect; teammates connect their own.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Airtable</b> — create a personal access token with <code>data.records:read</code> and <code>schema.bases:read</code> and access to your
            bases, then choose <b>Sync from Airtable</b> when adding a table. Pick a base, a table and all or some fields. The sync is one-way:
            Airtable stays the source, linked records show the linked record’s name, and attachments show their file names and links.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Gmail</b> — <b>Sign in with Google</b> and allow reading and sending email. Choose <b>Sync from Gmail</b> to bring messages matching a
            Gmail search (for example <code>in:inbox</code>) into a table, and use the <b>Send email via Gmail</b> automation step to send from your
            own address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Slack</b> — create a Slack app with the bot scopes <code>chat:write</code> and <code>channels:read</code>, install it and paste its bot
            token. The <b>Send Slack message</b> automation step then posts to any channel the bot is in (invite it with{" "}
            <code>/invite @your-app</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Warn>
          Automations run with the accounts of the person who last edited them. If someone else edits an automation with a Gmail or Slack step, they
          need to pick one of their own accounts in that step.
